                    <p>I have only recently taken my first steps into programming, but I can see that it's a field with
                        extremely wide application. Some of our adventures as software engineers will lead us to
                        building entire new apps, new games, or new websites, which may sound like too big of an
                        undertaking. Fortunately though, now that I have begun to learn, I can see those promethean
                        sized projects are built one piece at a time, like building legos or piecing together a puzzle.
                        Add one function here. Center a div there. Link the stylesheet. Suddenly like magic, the whole
                        becomes greater than the sum of it's parts.</p>

                        class="homeimg" />

                    <p>I think this quote fits well to not only the large projects that might be headed out way, but
                        also to the roles we will fill where maybe our responsiblities are only to the UI of a single
                        page. Maybe one day we find ourselves as hotshot programmers at Google, Meta, Apple, or anywhere
                        else, and our job is to design a submit button on a webpage. That contribution might be
                        considered "small", but if you look at the whole of the webpage or the company, our "small"
                        contribution has afforded end-users something that they need.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <div class="summary">

                    <p>Hello! My name is Jordan, and I'm currently a Java applications developer. I'm 25 years old,
                        and am a father of two amazing children.</p>

                    <p>You can find out more in my <a href="#experience"> experience section</a>, but a short summary
                        of my work experience and interests would be that I have a passion for safety. I am attracted to
                        roles and projects that contribute to the protection of users, and have spent the last few years
                        working in trust and safety positions at large tech companies in order to help remove bad actors
                        and ensure the safety of those platforms.</p>

                    <p>You can probably already tell by all of the gray and black, but I am not a front-end developer.
                        Unfortunately, I don't have a single creative bone in my body capable of coming up with my own
                        visual design. I am still quite able to follow design guides made by those creative types, but I
                        find back-end and app-sec more intersting.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="interests">

                    <h3>Interests</h3>

                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling and road tripping with my family, seeing nature, and watching
                        movies/playing video games with my wife (and one day hopefully my kids). When it comes to
                        movies I love just about anything, but I'm definitely drawn towards anything with good
                        cinematography.</p>

                    <img src="Images/iceland.jpg" alt="A night view of Iceland." />
                    <figcaption>A night view of Iceland. This is at the top of my wife and I's dream destinations.
                    </figcaption>

                    <p>As far as traveling goes, I've never left the United States. While I've seen a lot of beautiful
                        places here in the US, and still have lots more to see, I'm excited to one day travel outside of
                        the US and see nature in other parts of the world.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="wfh">

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>

                    <p>As I mentioned before, I just recently became a father! My son, the oldest, was born in 2021, and
                        his little sister a year later in 2022. Becoming a father has wildly changed my goals in life.
                        Before my kids came around, I didn't mind taking on the overnight shifts and sleeping all day or
                        working long hours that would have me gone 80+ hours a week. Driving to the office wasn't a
                        problem, and I was more than happy to be in management leading a team.</p>

                    <img src="Images/Work From Home with Kids.jpeg" alt="A father working from home with two kids." />

                    <p>Now that I have my children though, I want to be able to spend more time with my family. My
                        experience now as a software engineer has been amazing for my work life balance. The flexibility
                        of working towards a goal instead of working set hours has been a life saver. Being able to
                        finish a task and step away to make lunch for the family and pick right back up when I'm done is
                        a miracle. Putting the kids down for a nap and being able to jump into my work for the next day,
                        or having something I can work on during middle of the night feedings has helped me to be not
                        only a more active parent, but also a more productive worker.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="goals">

                    <h3>Goals</h3>

                    <p>A goal I have for my career in software engineering would be to be on a team that handles cyber
                        security. With so much of our lives now relying on technology, I want to be able to help protect
                        my children and the next generation from cyber attacks that might endanger their safety or
                        identities. The scale isn't the most important thing to me, whether it's security for a social
                        media app where they post pictures of their lives, or maybe on a broader scale like a government
                        position protecting from infrastucture attacks, I'd like to know my work helped to make people
                        safer.</p>

                                This product allows C1Conversations customers to connect their CRMs to our cloud storage
                                for constant backups of their data, as well as personalization into what data is stored
                                and how.

                                This project started with a group of four developers (including me), each working on a
                                solution for a different CRM. By the end of the project, I was the last remaining
                                developer, and I had to learn the ins and outs of the other three solutions in order to
                                combine them into one cohesive product to ship.

                                The product ended up being so popular, my next project was to expand the capablities of
                                the product to include more CRMs and more features, directly at the request of our
                                customers.

                                This backend allows users to perform all CRUD actions to the store's database.
                                Users can add new items to the inventory, remove items, updated existing items in the
                                inventory, and view all.
