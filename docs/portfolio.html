<!--The meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you've worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web. Since we don't have any projects to display yet, placeholder images/links/descriptions are completely fine.-->

                <h3>Project 3 - <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Apple/inventory-app">Inventory App</a></h3>
                
                <p>This project was our final group project in our 12 week boot camp. We were tasked with created a full stack application capable of managing inventory. The application has a working back end and front end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This backend allows users to perform all CRUD actions to the store's database.
                    Users can add new items to the inventory, remove items, updated existing items in the inventory, and view all.
                </p>

                <p>This project is a mock-up of an e-learning website similar to Udemy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The platform features user authentication and authorization, role based CRUD operations varying between the users, admins, and course instructors. Users can enroll in courses, instructors can add/remove courses, and admins can do all of the above and control the roles assigned to registered accounts.

                <p>
                    This project has an educational goal, but it also mimics some of the features and functionalities that major social networking apps like Instagram and Twitter offer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The main goal of this project was to develop a full stack application that can able run accross all environments with the help of Docker. The main features are user authentication and authorization (registration, signin and refresh token), role based CRUD operation on different posts, follow/unfollow other users, view profile and users reaction feature such as like and comment.</p>
